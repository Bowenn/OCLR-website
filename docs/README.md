# OCLR documentation

The repository root README ([English](../README.md) / [简体中文](../README.zh-Hans.md) / [繁體中文](../README.zh-Hant.md)) contains the project overview, a quick start and common commands. Detailed technical and operational material is organized here by responsibility.

**Where to start:** use [Development](development.md) to work locally, [Tournament administration](tournament-management.md) to understand enrollment and permissions, and [Deployment](deployment.md) for running or updating production. Never use production credentials or personal registration records in tests.

## Developer read API and remote frontend

- [Remote setup and troubleshooting](remote-development.md) — fresh frontend without a local DB/OAuth secret.
- [Full coverage and service boundaries](remote-coverage.md), [generated page/module inventory](remote-coverage.json).
- [Read API contract and browser/SSR examples](read-api.md), [OpenAPI](read-api.openapi.json).
- [Developer grant, short-lived access and exact-origin CORS](developer-api.md).

Local synthetic acceptance and actual CI are recorded per commit on #271/#272;
real grants/OAuth/deployment and new Chinese wording acceptance remain separate.

## Historical source preparation

- [S6 surviving sources and missing evidence](s6-archive.md) — source review and
  original artwork; not yet an uploadable archive package (#289).
- [S7 archive](s7-archive.md), [S8 archive](s8-archive.md),
  [S9 archive](s9-archive.md), [S10 archive](s10-archive.md).
