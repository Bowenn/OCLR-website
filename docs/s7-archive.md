# S7 historical archive preparation (#175)

Organizer-provided [S7 MainSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vZ7JN6ePxDqjdVZ1527fvyeoV1m5rbHzSvXObDUuf7I/edit?gid=1476192500), exported as XLSX on 2026-10-24. SHA-256: `51e1175e5e90837be7ef8b03de2575ca81f73dc4d7e1c1e58d905d237ee365a2`.

The source workbook includes application/contact material and is **not committed**. `scripts/prepare-s7-archive.py` reads only allowlisted competition cells, the C:D identity lookup referenced by roster avatar formulas, and staff signatures. It never executes formulas, calls a network service or writes a database. The application sheets, biographies, contact columns, comments, Damage evaluations and Chess are excluded.

## Verified coverage

| Source                               | Records and handling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Team List E3:U10                     | Eight teams in A–H source order. 56 playing members including eight Captains, plus eight assigned coaches. All 64 UIDs are evidenced in this workbook.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 测试表 C1:D57                        | 56 complete roster name/UID mappings referenced by Team List's VLOOKUP formulas. The unmatched final name has no UID and does not become a guessed identity. Case-insensitive lookup follows the original VLOOKUP behavior; display names stay literal.                                                                          |
| Team List H3:H10                     | Eight coach avatar formulas contain numeric UIDs even though their cached image cells show `#REF!`. These fixed literal IDs are extracted without executing the formulas.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Team List Tier columns               | 48 final Tier allocations, T1–T6. There is no selection log or captain order. `draftMode: "final-tiers"` preserves Tiers with an empty `picks` array. The draft page displays final Tier cards without invented pick numbers or selection chronology.                                                                            |
| 对阵表 A2:L13, A997:L1006            | 21 scored matches with unique MP IDs, plus the organizer-confirmed A8 forfeit. Two valid Bilibili VODs. Rows 997–1006 are actual knockout results and must not be lost by stopping at the blank template rows.                                                                                                                   |
| Team List A3:B10 and group fixtures  | Two four-team round-robin components, A/C/E/G and B/D/F/H. Presentation labels A/B follow component order. Win/loss totals reconcile when A8 is treated as a C win. No numeric official ranks or tiebreak rules are supplied. Map totals include only played scores.                                                             |
| Mappools B257:L275, B77:L91, B41:L57 | Three populated pools: 小组赛 15, 淘汰赛 15, 决赛 17, totaling 47. Preserve the original `ACE1` slots rather than relabeling them as TB. Historic SR/BPM/drain/CS/AR/OD stay unchanged; drain day-fractions become seconds. The last parenthesized suffix supplies the literal mapper.                                           |
| Staff A1:A9, C1:C9                   | Nine referee and nine streamer signatures, corroborated by per-match H/I columns. Seven signatures match UIDs already evidenced in the same workbook. The remaining 11 were resolved through reviewed public osu! profiles and existing edition identity evidence on 2026-10-24; see below. No account or permission is created. |

The complete Cover is empty. The Grand Finals pool and other unused round templates have no beatmaps; do not create empty pools or fabricate maps. Blank GS placeholders NM6/HD4/HR4/DT4 are not selected maps. Source match labels without participants/results are omitted. No S7 rulebook or edition artwork is supplied; do not reuse S8/S9/S10/S11 content.

The knockout source only explicitly labels 淘汰赛, LF and GF. Do not infer extra SF/Finals stage assignments from dates or map scores. Generated bracket edges retain the existing meaning of previous recorded team appearances.

## Organizer-confirmed corrections (2026-10-24)

1. The organizer confirmed that A7, A8, A9 and A10 use **2022** in place of the erroneous 2021 year. Month, day and time are unchanged: January 5 (A7), January 2 (A8/A10), January 3 (A9). Other source dates remain unchanged.
2. The organizer confirmed A8 as **C wins, G forfeits**. Preserve `score: null, forfeitWinner: 0`, with the original `0:-1` retained in review notes. Do not replace it with a normal map score. It counts as a result and contributes no played maps.

Finalized package: [imports/s7-archive.json](imports/s7-archive.json). It contains 22 recorded results (21 scored plus one forfeit), zero unconfirmed template fixtures, 64 identities, 48 final Tier allocations (zero chronological picks), 18 staff signatures and 47 maps.

## Staff identity follow-up (#176, 2026-10-24)

The organizer requested missing staff homepage links after the initial publication. All 11 previously name-only signatures now have reviewed numeric UIDs. Public osu! profile headings were checked against these identities; names are not resolved dynamically at runtime. The supplementary mappings are fixed in the preparation script so regenerating the package preserves them.

The seven original workbook-derived staff UIDs are unchanged. This update changes only staff identities, the confirmed referee spelling, and review provenance; teams, roster, dates, results, final Tiers and maps are unchanged.

## Compatibility and deployment handoff

No database migration. The schema adds optional `draftMode` and `forfeitWinner`, recognizes literal ACE slots, and allows a historical staff signature's UID to be null. Existing S8/S9/S10 packages retain their shape and behavior. Forfeit results cannot simultaneously carry fabricated played scores, final-Tier mode cannot claim chronological picks, and ordinary unconfirmed records remain hidden publicly. Existing edition scope, revision checks, explicit publication and audit transactions are unchanged.

Deploy this compatible build **before** any S7 import. Older strict parsers cannot read the additional S7 fields; rollback must keep compatible archive support rather than erase production audit/revision history.

After the organizer confirms deployment, use computer use at https://oclr.org/:

1. Check whether S7 already exists; do not overwrite unrelated content. Create/select private `s7`, name `OCLR Season 7`, season `7`, Completed, fixed UTC+8 (`Etc/GMT-8`), no registration or inherited S11 assets. Suggested factual summary: `osu! Chinese League Rookie — Season 7. 2021–2022 年歷史賽事歸檔。`
2. Upload and validate the finalized package, review notes/counts and save a private draft using the existing importer.
3. Review eight teams, 64 UID identities, 48 final Tier cards with no pick order, 18 staff signatures, all dates/results including the organizer's A8 decision, generated bracket and all three pools/47 maps. Rules remain unrecorded.
4. Publish separately when authorized, then verify anonymously on desktop/mobile and both themes. Record actual production evidence on #175; close only after import acceptance. Do not write directly to the production DB/API or deploy on the organizer's behalf.

## Local validation

Initial #175 validation: `npm run check`, production build and 45 targeted unit/integration tests passed. S7 was subsequently imported and published through computer use after explicit organizer approval, with anonymous desktop/mobile verification; the organizer performed deployment.

The #176 identity follow-up passes `npm run check`, production build, 25 archive unit tests and five transaction integration tests. Integration tests use only `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://emik@127.0.0.1:5432/oclr_archive_test`. Production dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities. The legacy-format browser test passes on desktop and mobile using installed Chrome (`PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome`): full S7 private file import, separate publication, all 18 staff links including the corrected name and numeric username `110`, final Tier cards, ACE filtering and forfeit schedule/bracket rendering in light/dark, including accessibility and overflow checks. Package regeneration is semantically identical; comparison against the previous package confirms no changes to teams, roster, dates, results, Tiers or maps. Formal production update evidence is recorded on #176 after the organizer authorizes the importer-required temporary unpublication.
